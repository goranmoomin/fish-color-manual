# fish-color-manual - Colorize man pages in fish shell

This is a very simple fisher package which colorizes the output of `man` which results in much nicer to read manual pages. It does so by simply setting some shell variables to colours. It's a shameless ripoff :smiley: from [omf-color-manual](https://github.com/spacekookie/omf-color-manual) and was ported to fisher for use.

## Installation

You should be able to install `fish-color-manual` via [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher).

```console
$ fisher add pcr910303/fish-color-manual
```

You can download `conf.d/color-manual.fish` and source it from `~/.config/fish/config.fish` if you want, but why would you? If you're one of the ones that don't use fisher, going to the original repo will be more beneficial.
